# Sincript

<img width="178" height="97" alt="{4166AFF4-89CF-41C6-84E0-CC0A51EE1796}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92274647-6952-4a5b-a115-0fe5c40d10f2" />

A single, menu-driven batch script (`PerfTweaks.cmd`) that applies a
**curated, reversible** set of performance, privacy, and maintenance tweaks for
**Windows 10 and Windows 11**.

Everything is opt-in from a menu, every registry change is backed up before it
is made, and the script can create a System Restore Point and a full registry
export on request. There is no silent "apply everything" — you choose what
runs.

The **runtime** is a single self-contained `PerfTweaks.cmd` (no installer, no
dependencies). The release also ships optional bundled inputs, a
timer-resolution helper, an example custom preset, and a developer test
harness — see [Release contents](#release-contents).

---

## Release contents

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| `PerfTweaks.cmd` | The tool — copy this anywhere you want to run it |
| `SetTimerResolution.exe` | Optional timer-resolution helper for the action |
| `boot.config`, `hosts` | Optional inputs for the Unity and hosts actions (place next to the script) |
| `sincript_presets/` | Folder for custom `.preset` files; includes `example.preset` |
| `tests/` | Static-analysis harness (`Run-Tests.ps1`) — for development/CI, not needed on end-user PCs |

---

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or Windows 11 (tested on recent builds, including 24H2 / build 26100).
- **Administrator rights** for the full feature set. The script **auto-elevates**: on launch it requests elevation through UAC and relaunches itself elevated. Approve the prompt for HKLM changes, services, BCD edits, restore points, and similar.
- If you **decline UAC** (or elevation probes are unavailable), the script warns and asks whether to continue in **limited mode** — only per-user (HKCU) tweaks and read-only status screens work reliably there; privileged actions report `[WARN]` instead of a misleading `[OK]`.
- No installation beyond copying the files you need.

## How to run

1. Place `PerfTweaks.cmd` anywhere (Desktop, a USB stick, etc.).
2. Double-click it (or right-click → *Run as administrator*).
3. Approve the UAC prompt.
4. Use the number keys to navigate the menu, then press `Enter`.

> **Recommended first step:** open **`8. Backups & status`** and create a
> **System Restore Point** and/or a **full registry backup** before applying
> anything.

### Sub-menus
- **Cleanup & repair** — Disk cleanup (with an optional, irreversible clear of **all Event Viewer logs**) · SFC + DISM repair · Windows Update reset · re-register Microsoft Store · compact WinSxS.
- **Network & DNS** — Apply TCP tweaks (autotuning, RSS/RSC; optional **Nagle / delayed-ACK off** for lower latency) · DNS menu (Cloudflare, Google, Quad9, or back to automatic/DHCP) · reset network stack.
- **Apps & files** — Install OpenAsar · apply a Unity `boot.config` · apply a custom `hosts` blocklist · restore the original `hosts` · install **SteamLight** (a lightweight Steam launcher + Desktop shortcut) · apply/remove a higher **timer resolution** (SetTimerResolution autostart) · remove built-in Store apps (**debloat**) · **manage startup programs** (flip Run-key and Startup-folder entries between Enabled and Disabled via the same reversible `StartupApproved` switch Task Manager uses; the prior state is saved to a `.reg` backup before every flip).

- **Backups & status** — Create a System Restore Point · export HKLM + HKCU · restore from a preset JSON backup · restore a single value backup (`.reg`) · manage/open the backup folder · show the current state of key tweaks, the active power plan, hibernation, minimum processor state, DNS, TCP autotuning, GPU hardware scheduling (HAGS), memory compression, the `hosts` line count, and whether OpenAsar is installed.

---

## Presets

**`10. Presets`** applies a whole bundle of tweaks in one go, with **no
per-item prompts** (only a couple of yes/no questions — restore point, and DNS
choice where relevant). There are three built-in presets plus your own custom
presets.

| Preset | What it applies | DNS |
|--------|-----------------|-----|
| **Light** | Cleanup core (temp/log cleanup, DNS flush), privacy/telemetry core, network core (TCP autotuning, RSS/RSC). Nothing risky. | Asks (Cloudflare / Google / Quad9 / skip) |
| **Moderate** | The full **recommended safe set** (cleanup + privacy + performance + power + network cores) — same as menu item 9. Optionally installs OpenAsar (bundled `app.asar` if present, otherwise downloads the latest nightly). | — (uses the safe set; DNS unchanged) |
| **Heavy** | Everything in the safe set **plus** foreground/latency tuning: `SystemResponsiveness = 0`, network throttling off, `Win32PrioritySeparation = 42`, Game Mode off, Nagle off, IPv6 off, NVMe flags, GPU telemetry off, BCD timers, memory compression off. | Asks (Cloudflare / Google / Quad9 / skip) |

**Heavy deliberately does *not* include** CPU-mitigation changes,
network-stack reset, system repair (SFC/DISM), debloat, `LargeSystemCache`, or
the timer-resolution autostart — those stay manual under their own menus. Heavy
shows a warning and offers a restore point first.

### Preset backups (JSON)

Manual menu actions each write their own tiny `.reg` backup. **Presets are
different:** every registry value a preset changes is recorded into **one JSON
file** in `Documents\PerfTweaks_Backups`, named `Preset_<name>_<random>.json`.
The script prints the exact path when the preset finishes.

To put those registry values back, use **`8. Backups & status → 4. Restore
from a preset backup (JSON)`** (also reachable from the Presets menu). It reads
the JSON and, per value, either restores the previous data or deletes the value
if it didn't exist before.

> The JSON backup covers **registry values only**. The non-registry parts of a
> preset — power plan, DNS, BCD timers, services/scheduled tasks — are reverted
> from their own menus (see *Reverting changes*). A System Restore Point
> (offered before moderate/heavy) rolls back everything at once.

## Custom presets

You can define your own preset as a small text file and have the script apply
it.

1. Create a folder named **`sincript_presets`** next to `PerfTweaks.cmd`.
2. Put a text file in it ending in **`.preset`** (e.g. `mypreset.preset`). A ready-to-edit **`example.preset`** ships with Sincript.
3. Run **`10. Presets → 4. Custom preset`**, pick your file, review the summary, and confirm.

### File format

- One directive per line, written as **`key=value`**.
- **No spaces around the `=`** (`cleanup=1`, not `cleanup = 1`).
- Start each directive in **column 1** (no leading spaces).
- A line beginning with **`#`** or **`;`** is a comment and is ignored.
- **Inline comments are not supported** — put comments on their own lines, not after a value.

### Keys

| Key | Value | Effect |
|-----|-------|--------|
| `cleanup` | `1` | Cleanup core (temp/log cleanup, DNS flush) |
| `privacy` | `1` | Privacy/telemetry core |
| `performance` | `1` | Performance core (GameDVR off, game-task priorities, UI timings) |
| `power` | `1` | Power core (Ultimate/High plan, no sleep/disk timeouts) |
| `network` | `1` | Network core (TCP autotuning, RSS/RSC) |
| `openasar` | `1` | Install OpenAsar silently (bundled `app.asar` if present, otherwise downloads the latest nightly) |
| `gamemode_off` | `1` | Disable Windows Game Mode |
| `systemresponsiveness` | `0` | `SystemResponsiveness = 0` (favor foreground) |
| `networkthrottling_off` | `1` | Network throttling off (`0xFFFFFFFF`) |
| `largesystemcache` | `1` | Enable `LargeSystemCache` *(situational; can hurt on desktops)* |
| `minprocstate5` | `1` | Minimum processor state 5% |
| `bcdtimers` | `1` | BCD timer set (`useplatformclock` off, `useplatformtick`/`disabledynamictick` on, TSC enhanced) |
| `ipv6_off` | `1` | Disable IPv6 (`DisabledComponents = 0xFF`) |
| `memcompress_off` | `1` | Disable memory compression *(raises RAM pressure on low-memory PCs)* |
| `nvme_flags` | `1` | NVMe feature flags *(may be blocked on fully-patched Windows)* |
| `gpu_telemetry_off` | `1` | Disable GPU telemetry (NVIDIA tasks + opt-out; opt-out on AMD) |
| `nagle_off` | `1` | Disable Nagle on all interfaces (`TcpAckFrequency` / `TCPNoDelay`) |
| `win32priority` | `42`, `26` or `2` | `Win32PrioritySeparation` — `42` = short fixed quantum (strong foreground), `26` = short variable quantum (strong foreground), `2` = Windows default |
| `dns` | `cloudflare`, `google`, or `quad9` | Set DNS on all active adapters |

Keys not listed here (and `1`-keys given any other value) are **rejected**.

### What happens with a bad file

The script validates the whole file first and shows a summary: how many
directives it recognized and how many problems it found, each listed
(`unknown key`, or `bad value … (expected …)`). Then:

- **Some valid, some bad** → it reports the problems and asks whether to apply the valid ones anyway.
- **Nothing valid** → it aborts without changing anything and points you back to this key list.

Like the built-in presets, a custom preset writes a single JSON registry backup
you can restore from the Backups menu.

---

## Safety & backups

The script is built around being undoable.

- **Per-value registry backups.** Before changing any registry value, the script saves a small `.reg` file with **only that one value's previous state** to `Documents\PerfTweaks_Backups` (~1 KB each). Double-click it to put the value back. Values containing quotes or empty `REG_SZ` data are backed up in a form that restores correctly; filenames use a wide random suffix so two values under the same key can't overwrite each other's undo file in one pass. Re-applying a value already at the target is skipped, so a redundant apply can't overwrite its original backup.
- **Full registry export** (optional) — exports all of `HKLM` and `HKCU` to `Documents\PerfTweaks_Backups`. It verifies both exports actually produced a file before reporting success, so a failed or partial backup (not elevated, or the folder isn't writable) is flagged `[ERROR]` instead of a misleading `[OK]`.
- **System Restore Point** (optional) — created on demand; `Apply recommended safe set` also offers to make one first.
- **Log file** — every action is logged to `Documents\PerfTweaks_Backups\PerfTweaks_<random>.log` as a clean `[timestamp] EXEC / OK / FAIL` timeline. It records each command's *outcome*, not its raw output, so it stays readable and doesn't fill with deleted-file paths or (on non-English Windows) garbled OEM-code-page error text.
- **Honest status lines.** Registry-heavy actions finish with `[OK]` only when every write succeeded; otherwise `[WARN]` with a count and inline `[FAIL]` lines pointing at what didn't apply (usually: not elevated, or a protected key). DNS, full-registry backup, OpenAsar, preset JSON restore, and admin-only repair actions (DISM/SFC, Windows Update reset, WinSxS compaction, memory compression) follow the same principle. The **apply hosts** action refuses to overwrite the system `hosts` file until a backup has landed.

All backups and logs live in **`Documents\PerfTweaks_Backups`** inside your user
**Documents** folder. The script auto-detects the real Documents path
(including OneDrive-redirected Documents) and falls back to
`%USERPROFILE%\Documents` if needed.

## Reverting changes

| Change | How to undo |
|--------|-------------|
| Any single registry tweak | Double-click its `.reg` backup in `Documents\PerfTweaks_Backups`, or use Backups & status → **Restore a single value backup (.reg)** |
| CPU mitigations | Advanced → **Enable mitigations** |
| Boot (BCD) timers | Advanced → **Revert BCD timers** |
| DNS | Network → DNS → **Automatic (DHCP)** |
| Custom `hosts` | Apps & files → **Restore hosts** |
| Timer resolution | Apps & files → **Remove timer resolution** |
| Windows Game Mode | Settings → Gaming → Game Mode (or merge the value backup) |
| Minimum processor state | Control Panel → power plan → set back to 100% |
| Removed built-in apps (debloat) | Reinstall from the Microsoft Store |
| Startup entry enabled/disabled | Flip it again under Apps & files → **Manage startup programs**, merge its `.reg` backup, or use Task Manager → Startup apps |
| Memory compression | PowerShell: `Enable-MMAgent -MemoryCompression` |
| Registry values changed by a preset | Backups & status → **Restore from a preset backup (JSON)** (or run the relevant menu item to reverse it) |
| Everything at once | Roll back to the **System Restore Point**, or import the **full registry backup** |

---

## Optional bundled files

Some actions can use files placed **next to `PerfTweaks.cmd`**. They are
optional:

- **`app.asar`** — an OpenAsar build for the Discord action. If absent, the script offers to download the latest nightly from the official OpenAsar GitHub releases (https://github.com/GooseMod/OpenAsar).
- **`boot.config`** — a Unity engine boot configuration applied to a game's `*_Data` folder.
- **`hosts`** — an ad/telemetry blocklist that the "apply hosts" action installs (the original is backed up first).
- **`SetTimerResolution.exe`** — the timer-resolution helper from [valleyofdoom/TimerResolution](https://github.com/valleyofdoom/TimerResolution). *Apps & files → Apply timer resolution* copies it to `C:\ProgramData\Sincript`, registers a hidden logon task that holds your chosen resolution, and (on Windows 10 2004+/11) sets the registry switch that makes the change system-wide.

**SteamLight** needs no bundled file. *Apps & files → Install SteamLight* finds
your Steam folder via the registry, writes a `SteamLight.bat` launcher **into
that folder**, and adds a `SteamLight` Desktop shortcut. The launcher starts
Steam with resource-saving flags (single process / single core, no shaders, no
shared textures, no Big Picture, high-DPI off, etc.) for lower RAM/CPU use. It
references `steam.exe` relative to its own folder, so it keeps working even if
Steam is on another drive. To change the flags, edit the single `_SLFLAGS=`
line.

## Recent changes

Newest first. Feature details live in the sections above — this is just what
changed.

- **Elevation works when the script path contains an apostrophe** (e.g. `C:\Users\O'Brien\`) — the UAC relaunch now passes `%~f0` via `$env:PT_SELF` instead of embedding it in `Start-Process -FilePath '…'`, where a `'` broke the string and killed the relaunch with no prompt.
- **Per-value backups decline non-ASCII string data instead of corrupting it.** Undo files are written with `echo` (console code page), so non-ASCII `REG_SZ` *prior data* came back as mojibake; such values are now marked *not auto-restorable — use the full backup* (like `REG_BINARY`) and skipped on preset restore. The full `reg export` still restores them correctly.
- **Idempotent registry writes.** Applying a value already at the target prints `[SKIP] … already set` and returns **before** writing a backup, so a re-run or re-applied preset can't bury the true-original undo.
- **Safe defaults on confirmation prompts.** Each `(Y/N)` gate clears its variable first, so a bare **Enter** = *skip* rather than a stale `Y` (restore-point prompts default to **Yes**). This stops the irreversible **clear-all-Event-Viewer-logs** step firing from a stray Enter.
- **Cleaner log file.** `:Run` logs only `[timestamp] EXEC / OK / FAIL`, not raw command output (which dumped file paths and garbled OEM-code-page errors on non-English Windows). Outcomes are still recorded.
- **SteamLight reports honestly.** `[OK]` is gated on the launcher `.bat` actually being written, so an unwritable Steam folder (e.g. under `Program Files` without elevation) yields `[ERROR]` instead of false success.
- **Honest registry-action reporting.** Registry-heavy actions/presets track a failure tally, print inline `[FAIL]`, and finish via `:Summary` with `[OK]`/`[WARN]`; `:Run` counts failure only when genuinely not elevated. Guarded by tests 13–15, 24–25, 27.
- **Limited mode when UAC is declined.** On failed elevation the script sets a not-elevated flag, explains HKLM/service/boot changes won't work, and asks to continue per-user-only; repair actions gate their final line on elevation. Guarded by tests 17, 28.
- **Preset parser empty-value guard.** A `key=` line with no value no longer aborts the script. Guarded by test 16.
- **hosts apply requires a backup first** — confirmed landed before overwriting the system `hosts`. Guarded by test 18.
- **Preset JSON restore honesty + quote-safe REG_SZ.** `[WARN]`/`[ERROR]` on partial/unreadable backups; `REG_SZ` restores via `Set-ItemProperty` so quotes survive. Guarded by tests 19, 23.
- **OpenAsar targets the newest Discord build by version**, not folder-name order (which could pick an older build after a digit rollover). Guarded by test 20.
- **Per-value backup integrity.** Quotes in prior `REG_SZ` data are escaped, empty values handled, and filenames use `%RANDOM%%RANDOM%` so two values under one key can't collide. Guarded by tests 21–22.
- **SteamLight handles apostrophes in the Steam path** via an environment variable. Guarded by test 26.
- **Static test harness expanded to 28 checks** (`tests/Run-Tests.ps1`, dependency-free PowerShell 5.1; `tests/README.md` lists each) — now also guarding honest reporting, elevation, backup integrity, and preset restore.
- **Startup programs manager (Apps & files).** New *Manage startup programs* item lists the `Run` keys (HKCU, HKLM, HKLM-WOW64) and both Startup folders and flips entries **Enabled**/**Disabled** via the reversible `StartupApproved` switch Task Manager uses. Nothing is deleted; each flip saves prior state to a tiny UTF-16 `.reg` backup (so non-ASCII names restore), and one PowerShell worker with a fixed sort order flips localized (e.g. Cyrillic) names exactly. Guarded by test 12.
- **Fixed: restoring/resetting the hosts file crashed the script.** An unescaped `)` in `(AV tamper protection?)` inside a one-line `if ( ) else ( )` ended the block early and aborted the batch (*"was unexpected at this time"*) after the file was already written. The parens are escaped and test 9 (cmd block-parse simulation) now catches any unescaped `)` in a block.
- **Fixed: the Ultimate power plan never activated, and clones piled up.** `powercfg -duplicatescheme` with no destination GUID minted a random-GUID copy each run while `/setactive` targeted the canonical GUID, so the High Performance fallback activated and a clone accrued per power-core run. Duplication now targets the canonical GUID itself. Guarded by test 10.
- **Fixed: a failed OpenAsar download could install a broken file.** `Invoke-WebRequest` can leave a partial file, and both paths only checked existence; they now trust the child exit code and delete the leftover first. Guarded by test 11.
- **No more false "success" messages (first wave).** The **full registry backup** confirms both `HKLM` and `HKCU` exports wrote a file (else `[ERROR]`); **DNS apply/reset** counts adapters changed vs failed (e.g. `3 adapter(s), 0 failed`); **OpenAsar** reports which backup was saved, since AV / Controlled Folder Access often blocks the copy into Discord's own folder.
- **Performance: a single `Win32PrioritySeparation` choice** — `1` = 42, `2` = Windows default, `N` = unchanged. The old paired prompts could be a no-op and snapshotted the just-set 42 as the undo.
- **Prefetch is no longer cleared** — it's placebo (Windows rebuilds it) and against the script's own stance; removed from cleanup/recommended/presets and listed on **What was excluded**.
- **Backup-folder manager (Backups & status).** New *Manage / open backup folder* item summarizes `Documents\PerfTweaks_Backups` by category (counts + MB), opens it in Explorer, and offers a safe prune of **older full-registry exports** while keeping the newest pair. The small `.reg` and preset-JSON undo data is never deleted.
- **In-app single-value restore (Backups & status).** New *Restore a single value backup (.reg)* item lists per-value `.reg` backups (newest first) and re-imports your pick, logged; full-registry exports (`FullReg_*.reg`) are filtered out. The preset-JSON restore is unchanged.
- **Per-app CPU priority (Advanced).** New *Set permanent process priority* pins a per-`.exe` priority (High / Above normal / Normal / Below normal / Low) via Image File Execution Options (`CpuPriorityClass`), reversible with *Remove override*. Target the `.exe` that actually runs (Task Manager → Details); Realtime isn't offered.
- **Reversibility + WinUtil tweaks.** Nagle and the per-user sync-services disable are now backed up, and the status helper is hardened against a `>` in registry data. Added opt-in items: mouse acceleration off, show file extensions, and **Activity History** off (`PublishUserActivities` / `UploadUserActivities`).
- **GPU hardware scheduling (HAGS).** New Advanced toggle for `HwSchMode` (reversible; needs a reboot and Windows 10 2004+ with a supporting GPU). Kept out of presets because turning it off disables features like NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation.
- **AMD telemetry opt-out.** The GPU-telemetry action and `gpu_telemetry_off` key now also opt out of the **AMD User Experience Program** (backed up), pointing to AMD Software → Preferences. Previously a no-op on AMD.
- **Status screen + localization.** Adds hibernation, minimum processor state, HAGS and memory compression (read-only), and — with DNS apply/reset — no longer depends on English output: it reads registry/cmdlet properties, filters TCP via `netsh` on the `:` separator (dodging `Get-NetTCPSetting` where `MSFT_NetTCPSetting` is missing), and applies DNS to all physical adapters. Works on Cyrillic Windows.
- **Presets, custom presets & JSON backups.** New **`10. Presets`** menu (light / moderate / heavy + custom `.preset` files), each writing one restorable JSON backup; *What was excluded* moved to item 11.
- **Console-font fix.** The last two inline-PowerShell spots (Unity core detection, `boot.config` rewrite) use the minimized-window pattern; boot.config paths pass via environment variables.
- **Community-guide tweaks.** BCD timers also set `useplatformtick yes`; optional minimum processor state 5%; optional Game Mode off; a *debloat* action (apps reinstallable from the Store).
- **Timer resolution.** SetTimerResolution installs as a hidden logon task plus a system-wide registry switch (needs a reboot); fully removable.
- **Backups moved to Documents** (`Documents\PerfTweaks_Backups`, OneDrive-aware) instead of the drive root.
- **Console compatibility (Windows 10 / Server 2022).** ASCII-only / no BOM, echo-off guard, working-directory fix, suppressed `mode`/`color` errors, ASCII logo — so `@echo off` and the menu render on legacy `cmd.exe`.
- **Unity `boot.config` is CPU-aware** — sets `job-worker-count` / `-maximum-count` to logical processors − 1 before copying into the game's `*_Data` folder.
- **Bundled-file error handling.** Missing/empty `boot.config` or `hosts`, and copy failures, now stop with a clear message.

---

## Notes & caveats

- **Run as administrator.** HKLM changes, services, scheduled tasks, BCD edits, and restore points all need elevation. The script elevates itself; approve UAC for the full toolset. In limited mode after declining UAC, expect `[WARN]` on privileged actions — intentional honesty, not a bug.
- **Backups go to your Documents.** They're written under the account that is elevated. On a normal single-admin PC (UAC consent prompt) that's your own Documents; if you elevate with a *different* administrator account, they land in that account's Documents instead.
- **A reboot is recommended** after several tweaks (memory compression, mitigations, NVMe flags, boot timers, timer resolution) for them to fully take effect.
- **Brief minimized windows.** Some actions (DNS, Store re-register, OpenAsar download, restore point, the status screen) run PowerShell in a short-lived minimized window so the main window's font/colors aren't disturbed. The flicker is normal.
- **The "Advanced" menu is genuinely advanced.** A few highlights:
  - *Disable CPU mitigations* trades security hardening (Spectre/Meltdown-class) for speed. Only do this where you understand the trade-off.
  - *NVMe feature flags* may be blocked by Microsoft on fully-patched systems; the script tells you so.
  - *Disable memory compression* frees a little CPU but increases RAM pressure on low-memory PCs.
- **Opt-in only.** Riskier items such as disabling mitigations and enabling `LargeSystemCache` are never part of the "recommended safe set" — you must select them yourself.
- **Console appearance.** The script uses a magenta theme and a small "SIN" logo. It runs in your default console font (Consolas on most systems) and changes no system-wide console, scaling, or registry settings beyond the tweaks you choose.

## "What was excluded" — the philosophy

The in-app **`11. What was excluded`** screen lists, by category, the popular
"tweaks" this script intentionally omits — for example security-weakening
changes (disabling Defender, the firewall, UAC, or SmartScreen), placebo or
obsolete registry values, clearing the Prefetch folder (Windows just rebuilds
it, slowing the next few launches), firewall rules that block Google/YouTube IP
ranges, hard-coded MTU values, and bulk undocumented GPU dumps. It also covers
items from popular gaming guides that are deliberately skipped — Windows
activation scripts, replacing Defender with a third-party antivirus, aggressive
RAM / standby "cleaners", and forcing MSI mode or NIC parameter edits (which the
experienced guides themselves advise against). Read it to understand the safety
rationale.

---

## Tests

Sincript ships with a **static-analysis** harness in `tests/`. `PerfTweaks.cmd`
is interactive and changes the system, so it can't be safely unit-tested by
*running* it; instead `tests/Run-Tests.ps1` (28 checks on stock Windows
PowerShell 5.1 — no Pester) parses the script text for invariants that tend to
break silently, including:

- every menu `goto` / `call` resolves to a real label
- no unescaped `)` inside a `( )` block (cmd parser simulation — that class of bug crashed the hosts restore)
- no duplicate `boot.config` keys; `example.preset` keys match the in-script validator
- honest reporting (`:Summary`, `_FAILS`, elevation gating, DNS/OpenAsar/backup guards) does not regress
- backup undo integrity (quote escaping, collision-resistant filenames, hosts backup-before-overwrite)

Run from the repository root:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tests\Run-Tests.ps1
```

Exit code `0` means all 28 checks passed; `1` means at least one failed, with
the offending detail printed. See `tests/README.md` for the full numbered list.

## Disclaimer

Use at your own risk. These tweaks modify system settings; while the script
backs up each change and can create a restore point, you are responsible for
your system. **Make a restore point and/or a full registry backup first** (the
script provides both). Sincript is an independent utility and is not affiliated
with or endorsed by Microsoft, NVIDIA, AMD, Discord, or any other vendor
mentioned.
